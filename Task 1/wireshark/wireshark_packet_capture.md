# Wireshark Packet Capture

This document explains how Wireshark was used during **Task 1**, including:

- How to start packet capture on Windows
- How to apply filters to view scan-related traffic
- What packets to look for during an Nmap SYN scan
- How to take screenshots for documentation
- What to include in your GitHub submission

This ensures your Wireshark analysis meets professional reporting standards.

# 🎯 Purpose of Wireshark

Wireshark helps you **visually inspect network traffic** generated by your Nmap scan. It validates:

- SYN packets being sent to scan ports
- Device responses (SYN-ACK for open ports, RST for closed ports)
- The overall communication pattern between your scanner and target hosts

This adds strong evidence and demonstrates understanding of network-level behavior.

# 🟦 1. Starting Wireshark Capture (Windows)

### Step-by-step

1. Open **Wireshark** (Run as Administrator recommended).
2. Select your active interface:
   - `Wi-Fi` (for wireless connections)
   - `Ethernet` (for wired)
3. Click **Start Capturing Packets** (blue shark fin icon).
4. Keep Wireshark running in the background while performing the Nmap scan.

You should see packets flowing in real-time.

# 🟦 2. Perform the Required Nmap Scan

From a separate CMD window:

```bash
nmap -sS 192.168.XXX.XXX/24
```

This will generate SYN traffic visible inside Wireshark.

# 🟦 3. Apply Important Filters

To properly analyze the scan, apply these filters in Wireshark’s filter bar.

## A. View outgoing SYN packets (scan attempts)

```
tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0
```

These are packets your PC sends to check if a port is open.

## B. View SYN/ACK responses (open ports)

```
tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 1
```

These responses indicate **open ports**.

## C. View RST responses (closed ports)

```
tcp.flags.rst == 1
```

This indicates the port is **closed**.

## D. Only show traffic between you and a specific host

```
ip.addr == 192.168.223.243
```

## E. Only TCP traffic

```
tcp
```

These filters help isolate Nmap traffic clearly.

# 🟦 4. What Packets to Look For

During a SYN scan, you should capture:

1. SYN → Sent by your machine  
   This is Nmap probing a port.

2. SYN/ACK → Port is open  
   The device responds with SYN/ACK if the port is available.

3. RST → Port is closed  
   The device replies with a reset if the port is unavailable.

4. No response → Port filtered  
   Firewall or filtering device may be blocking the probe.

# 🟦 5. Saving the Packet Capture

After your scan:

1. Go to **Capture → Stop**
2. Click **File → Save As**
3. Save the file as:

```
wireshark_packet_capture.pcap
```

**Note**

- If the file contains sensitive IP addresses, anonymize before uploading (I have already done it using a scapy script).
